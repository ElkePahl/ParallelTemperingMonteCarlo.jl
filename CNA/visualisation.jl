module Visualisation # This module converts a configuration and its classifications into a coloursied .vesta file
export vestaFile # This function outputs a colourised .vesta file

"""
This function converts a classified configuration into a colourised .vesta file. It does this by using a reference .vesta file,
'blueprint.vesta', and only changes the lines corresponding to atom coordinates and colours based on detected symmetries.

Inputs:
configDir: (String) The path to (or name of, if in the local directory) the directory containing the .xyz files.
fileName: (String) The unique prefix of the fileName.
configurations: (Array{Float64}) 3D array containing the atom coordinates for each configuration in the file.
classifications: Vector{Dict{Vector{Int64},String}} Vector of dictionaries mapping a list of atoms to their symmetry.
capSymmetries: Vector{Dict{Dict{Int64,Vector{Int64}},String}} Vector of dictionaries mapping list of atoms forming a cap to their symmetry.
rCut: (Float64) The cut-off radii used in the CNA analysis in units of EBL. Default is 4/3.
EBL: (Float64) Equilibrium Bond Length. Default is 3.1227 Angstroms (from MP2 data for Neon2).
L: (Int64) The number of configurations in the file.
N: (Int64) The number of atoms in each configuration.

"""
This function determines a colour (RGB values) for an atom given its indentified symmetries.
The colours have the following meanings:
Red -> icosahedral, Orange -> BCC, Green -> FCC, Blue -> HCP, Purple -> OTHER,Black -> No identifiable structure.
The shades of the colour also have meanings. Darker shades mean the atom is part of an identified atom core. Light shades mean the atom is a
'cap' atom. An inbetween shade means the atom is either a capped atom or if core classification failed but the atom still has an identified symmetry.

Inputs:
atomNum: (Int64) The atom number to be colourised based off the order the atoms were listed in the .xyz file.
classifications: Dict{Vector{Int64},String} Dictionary mapping a list of atoms to their symmetry.
capSymmetries: Dict{Dict{Int64,Vector{Int64}},String} Dictionary mapping list of atoms forming a cap to their symmetry.

Outputs:
colour: (String) String representation of the RGB values that make up the desired colour for the input atom.
